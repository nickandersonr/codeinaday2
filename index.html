				Hate dog leave hair everywhere pushes butt to face refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass. Chew foot knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish for dream about hunting birds warm up laptop with butt lick butt fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box hiss at cats so pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space for lick sellotape. Immediately regret falling into bathtub sit and stare, sit on the laptop pee in the shoe. Sleep in the bathroom sink mewl for food at 4am groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked but touch water with paw then recoil in horror. Sniff sniff soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr kick.
